# User
The `user` table stores authentication information of the users registered in MobyDQ. It is also used to automate database roles management in PostgreSQL. When a user is created in the `user` table, the following operations are triggered:
* A new user role `user_<id>` is created in the `pg_roles` table.
* If `flag_admin` is set to `True`, the `user_<id>` role is granted the `admin` role.
* If `flag_admin` is set to `False`, the `user_<id>` role is granted the default `standard` role.
* The `user_<id>` role is automatically granted the default Public user group role `user_group_0`.

# User Group
User groups define a set of users who can access a common set of indicators and data sources. The user group concept is used to manage row level security on the data which means users can only see the records which belong to their groups. When a user group is created in the `user_group` table, a new user group role `user_group_<id>` is created in the `pg_roles` table.

# User Group User
The table `user_group_user` is used to manage the assignment of users to user groups. When a user is associated to a user group in the `user_group_user` table, the user group role `user_group_<id>` is automatically granted to the `user_<id>` role in the `pg_roles` table.
